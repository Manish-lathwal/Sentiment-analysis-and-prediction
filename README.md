# Sentiment-analysis-and-prediction
In this project, I tried to find a connection between the sentiment of news headlines and stock price movement and further forecastedÂ stock price movement based on the sentiment scoring from the prior period!

News headlines data available on: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miguelaenlle/massive-stock-news-analysis-db-for-nlpbacktests?select=analyst_ratings_processed.csv

Stock price data gathered from yFinance package.

Analysis on the following stocks:

FB
AAPL
GOOGL
TSLA
NFLX
MSFT
vaderSentiment and Hugging Face were used for sentiment analysis.

Using the sentiment scores built Neural Network and XGBoost models. Also compared the model performances.
